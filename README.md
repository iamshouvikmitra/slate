# Slate  📝
Slate Notes takes html (or other data), compresses it into a URL fragment, and provides a link that can be shared. When it is opened, it renders that data on the receiver’s side. Its live [here](http://iamshouvikmitra.github.io/slate).

# About
Slate Notes are contained entirely within their own link. (Including this one!) This means they're... <br>

💼 Portable - you don't need a server to host them <br>
👁 Private - nothing is sent to–or stored on–this server <br>
🎁 Easy to share as a link or QR code <br>

Slate Notes can hold about as much as a printed page, and there is a lot you can do with that: <br>
✒️ Compose poetry <br>
🛠 Create an app <br>
🐦 Bypass a 140 280 char limit <br>
🎨 Express yourself in ascii <br>

## Hosting
One simple way to host is to forward a domain. Just paste your slate's url in the redirect.<br>
